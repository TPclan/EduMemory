# Creating My Poster

### Screen shots of development process and finished product

##### (Picture of HTML for home page buttons)
This picture is how you create a button using HTML. All you need to do is write a button tag that looks like this <button>(text on button)</button>. This will create a simple button that will like quite ugly.

##### (Picture of CSS for button)
This picture shows how you can use another language of code called CSS to style your button. In this image what I did was simply make a background color and set  it to the color i wanted the botton to be. "border-radius: 25px;" will round the corners of the button. To give refrence 50px will make a perfect circle. Another important thing I did here was add a hover effect so when you hover over it the background color changes to whatever I want it to be I did this with the "&:hover" and then in curly brackets put "color: (yourcolor)".

##### (show picture of finished product)
Here is what the finished product of the buttons looked like. You can see the styling above is how I made them look like this.

##### My Global contect is: Scientific and technical innovation

##### My Inquiry question is: How do you create an app using coding?

##### Why is this project personally meaningful and challenging
This project is personally meaningful to me because  it something that I love doing and can open alot of doors for me in the future, there us si much more you can do with coding then just building an app. This was especially challenging because I need to put alot of time and research into this project and and learn different types of code. One really challenging thing about creating an app is if you get one character wrong, the whole thing breaks (which has happened multiple times during the making of this project).
