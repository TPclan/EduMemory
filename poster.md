# Creating My Poster

### Screen shots of development process and finished product

##### (Picture of HTML for home page buttons)
This picture is how you create a button using HTML. All you need to do is write a button tag that looks like this <button>(text on button)</button>. This will create a simple button that will like quite ugly.

##### (Picture of CSS for button)
This picture shows how you can use another language of code called CSS to style your button. In this image what I did was simply make a background color and set  it to the color i wanted the botton to be. "border-radius: 25px;" will round the corners of the button. To give refrence 50px will make a perfect circle. Another important thing I did here was add a hover effect so when you hover over it the background color changes to whatever I want it to be I did this with the "&:hover" and then in curly brackets put "color: (yourcolor)".

##### (show picture of finished product)
Here is what the finished product of the buttons looked like. You can see the styling above is how I made them look like this.

#### My Global contect is: Scientific and technical innovation

#### My Inquiry question is: How do you create an app using coding?

#### Why is this project personally meaningful and challenging
This project is personally meaningful to me because  it something that I love doing and can open alot of doors for me in the future, there us si much more you can do with coding then just building an app. This was especially challenging because I need to put alot of time and research into this project and and learn different types of code. One really challenging thing about creating an app is if you get one character wrong, the whole thing breaks (which has happened multiple times during the making of this project).

#### Key information and challenges about your project/ the developement of your project.
There were alot of challenges during this project. Learning how to use java script, html, css were huge learning curves (3 languages of code). When coding organizational skills are very import and challenging because if you need to look back somewhere in your code that is not organized it can be very time consuming. You need to pay close attention to each letter and look back to make sure you didn't make mistakes because if you get one character wrong you break your whole project. It was also a great challenge learning how to use the vode editor (vscode) with github, a website where you can store your code and share it with others. 

#### Key information from the research I completed.
I learned how to write and understand multiple languages of code. I learned different libraries and frameworks. Alot of the time when coding you get stuck for hours even days, so in order to pass this when I really couldn't figure something out, I would go to a website called stackoverflow where they help you when your stuck. This was not as easy as saying, "I need help". I learned how to ask proper questions in order for people to understand and explains thing to people properly.

#### Key atl skills that I developed during this project
One atl skill I learned while doing this project was organizational skills. In order for code to work it has to be organized properly. Also there is a variety of alternative ways to organize your code in order to know where things are, find bugs when you make a mistake, and making it easier to read for yourself and others. 
Another atl skill I learned while doing this project was creative thinking. While making this app I had to think of what do I want it to look like? What do I want it to be called? And constantly thing of creative ways to make the app better looking and functioning better.
