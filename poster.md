# Creating My Poster

### Screen shots of development process and finished product

##### (Picture of HTML for home page buttons)
This picture is how you create a button using HTML. All you need to do is write a button tag that looks like this <button>(text on button)</button>. This will create a simple button that will like quite ugly.

##### (Picture of CSS for button)
This picture shows how you can use another language of code called CSS to style your button. In this image what I did was simply make a background color and set  it to the color i wanted the botton to be. "border-radius: 25px;" will round the corners of the button. To give refrence 50px will make a perfect circle. Another important thing I did here was add a hover effect so when you hover over it the background color changes to whatever I want it to be I did this with the "&:hover" and then in curly brackets put "color: (yourcolor)".

##### (show picture of finished product)
Here is what the finished product of the buttons looked like. You can see the styling above is how I made them look like this.
